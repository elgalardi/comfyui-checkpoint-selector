This node allows you to connect up to 3 checkpoint loaders in order to load them into memory and not waste time waiting when loading models for testing. I made this node for the backend of a page so that it does not waste time when the user changes the model.

Install:

git clone: https://github.com/elgalardi/comfyui-checkpoint-selector.git into ComfyUI\custom_nodes
